# Green Invoice API Notes

This GitHub repository contains my personal notes on working with the **Green Invoice API**, the primary accounting and invoicing platform widely used in Israel.

Much of the official documentation is written in Hebrew and lacks comprehensive English translations. This repository aims to fill that gap by providing clear, English-language notes, examples, and clarifications for developers seeking to integrate with or better understand the Green Invoice API.

## Contents

- Notes on API endpoints and usage
- English translations of key terms and document types
- Sample requests and responses
- Common integration patterns

## Disclaimer

These notes are unofficial and based on my personal experience using the API. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please refer to the [official Green Invoice documentation](https://app.greeninvoice.co.il/api).
